# Lesson 2: Testing Getters

In this [lesson](), we are going to use what we learned in the previous lesson to unit test getters and refactor our code.

Weâ€™ll also take a look at ava test contexts. Same as the previous lesson, Vuex knowledge is not required but it will be helpful :). If you have no idea what Vuex is, we recommend you to have a look at getters on the official guide.
